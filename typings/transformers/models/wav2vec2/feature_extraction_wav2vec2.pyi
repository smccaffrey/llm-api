class Wav2Vec2FeatureExtractor(SequenceFeatureExtractor):
    r"""
    Constructs a Wav2Vec2 feature extractor.

    This feature extractor inherits from [`~feature_extraction_sequence_utils.SequenceFeatureExtractor`] which contains
    most of the main methods. Users should refer to this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

    Args:
        feature_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 1):
            The feature dimension of the extracted features.
        sampling_rate (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 16000):
            The sampling rate at which the audio files should be digitalized expressed in hertz (Hz).
        padding_value (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.0):
            The value that is used to fill the padding values.
        do_normalize (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether or not to zero-mean unit-variance normalize the input. Normalizing can help to significantly
            improve the performance for some models, *e.g.*,
            [wav2vec2-lv60](https://huggingface.co/models?search=lv60).
        return_attention_mask (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not [`~Wav2Vec2FeatureExtractor.__call__`] should return `attention_mask`.

            <Tip>

            Wav2Vec2 models that have set `config.feat_extract_norm == "group"`, such as
            [wav2vec2-base](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h), have **not** been trained using
            `attention_mask`. For such models, `input_values` should simply be padded with 0 and no `attention_mask`
            should be passed.

            For Wav2Vec2 models that have set `config.feat_extract_norm == "layer"`, such as
            [wav2vec2-lv60](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self), `attention_mask` should be
            passed for batched inference.

        Main method to featurize and prepare for the model one or several sequence(s).

        Args:
            raw_speech (`np.ndarray`, `List[float]`, `List[np.ndarray]`, `List[List[float]]`):
                The sequence or batch of sequences to be padded. Each sequence can be a numpy array, a list of float
                values, a list of numpy arrays or a list of list of float values. Must be mono channel audio, not
                stereo, i.e. single float per timestep.
            padding (`bool`, `str` or [`~utils.PaddingStrategy`], *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Select a strategy to pad the returned sequences (according to the model's padding side and padding
                index) among:

                - `True` or `'longest'`: Pad to the longest sequence in the batch (or no padding if only a single
                  sequence if provided).
                - `'max_length'`: Pad to a maximum length specified with the argument `max_length` or to the maximum
                  acceptable input length for the model if that argument is not provided.
                - `False` or `'do_not_pad'` (default): No padding (i.e., can output a batch with sequences of different
                  lengths).
            max_length (`int`, *optional*):
                Maximum length of the returned list and optionally padding length (see above).
            truncation (`bool`):
                Activates truncation to cut input sequences longer than *max_length* to *max_length*.
            pad_to_multiple_of (`int`, *optional*):
                If set will pad the sequence to a multiple of the provided value.

                This is especially useful to enable the use of Tensor Cores on NVIDIA hardware with compute capability
                `>= 7.5` (Volta), or on TPUs which benefit from having sequence lengths be a multiple of 128.
            return_attention_mask (`bool`, *optional*):
                Whether to return the attention mask. If left to the default, will return the attention mask according
                to the specific feature_extractor's default.

            return_tensors (`str` or [`~utils.TensorType`], *optional*):
                If set, will return tensors instead of list of python integers. Acceptable values are:

                - `'tf'`: Return TensorFlow `tf.constant` objects.
                - `'pt'`: Return PyTorch `torch.Tensor` objects.
                - `'np'`: Return Numpy `np.ndarray` objects.
            sampling_rate (`int`, *optional*):
                The sampling rate at which the `raw_speech` input was sampled. It is strongly recommended to pass
                `sampling_rate` at the forward call to prevent silent errors.
